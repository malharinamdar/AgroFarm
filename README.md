# AgroFarm
ML Based agricultural crop recommendation website.
In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation.

In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
# Method of Working
We used logistic regression algorithm for its working since the output (crop) was fixed having 20 specific outputs and the input parameters could vary. 
We could have used decision trees as well but went ahead with logistic regression for its simplicity.
