# AgroFarm
ML Based agricultural crop recommendation website.
In this project, I present a website in which the suitable crop to grow is recommended based on input soil data by user.

# Method of Working
We used logistic regression algorithm for its working since the output (crop) was fixed having 20 specific outputs and the input parameters could vary.
